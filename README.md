# Student Project Python Bindings
The student project investigates the performance and memory handling of Python bindings for CUDA C++ code created with pybind11.

# Structure

## phase-retrieval

Contains the Python implementation of the algorithm as `git submodule`. The original repository is located at https://github.com/tuelwer/phase-retrieval.

## CUDA phase-retrival

The latest CUDA implementation of the phase-retrieval algorithm can be found in the folder `cuda_phase-retrieval_class`.

## presentation

Contains the presentation for the lecture.

## python\_bindings\_example

Contains different examples to demonstrate how pybind11 can be used. The alpaka example is not relevant for the task, but could be used for an extra task.
